<body> . </p>Drums are a type of percussion instrument that produce sound when a stretched membrane,<br>
    or "drumhead," is struck with a hand, sticks, or mallets. They are a foundational element <br>
    in music, providing rhythm and setting the tempo. A common setup is the <b>drum kit</b>, a  <br>
    collection of various drums and cymbals that a single player can perform on. </p>
